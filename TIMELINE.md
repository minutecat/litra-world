# Timeline (Intentionally Partial)

This file tracks **known anchors** rather than a full chronology.

Absence here does not mean events did not happen.
It means they are not yet narratively necessary.

---

## Before the Story
- The planet establishes the law known as **Getting Lost**
- Tribal territories stabilize into hexagonal systems
- Rooks emerge as border-bound observers and caretakers
- Empty territories are rare, poorly understood, and feared

---

## Early Life
- The Wanderer is born in **Banks**
- Trained for eventual relocation
- Learns adaptation before belonging
- Childhood details are deliberately blurred (by design)

---

## The Relocation
- The Wanderer is relocated by the planet
- Arrives in an **abandoned territory** (formerly Guards)
- Becomes mono-colored due to loss of tribal continuity
- Finds traces of prior habitation but no answers

---

## First Movement
- Leaves the empty territory
- Contacts a rook at the border
- Receives information without instruction
- Chooses certainty over paralysis

---

## First Populated Tribe
- Enters a functioning tribe (later identified as **Mediators**)
- Experiences low status as a mono-colored male
- Observes moral softness around petty theft
- The “fish incident” occurs

---

## The Breaker of Silence
- A low-status female later known as **Clue** follows him
- Formal examination occurs
- Trust is established through attentiveness, not dominance
- She becomes an early moral mirror, not an anchor

---

## Beyond
From here, the timeline intentionally fractures.

The story continues through:
- Further tribes
- Skill accumulation
- Rook encounters
- The Fortress
- Return paths that are not reversals

These will be filled only when required.
