# Canon (stable truths)

## Planet law: "Getting Lost"
- Children may be relocated by the planet ("getting lost").
- This is systemic, not punishment.

## Colors and status
- Tri-color is the typical state.
- Mono-color signals interrupted growth / missing formal belonging.
- Social hierarchy often treats mono-color as permanently limited.

## Rooks
- Some litrans lose a color when bypassing tribal borders.
- They become "Rooks": border-adjacent caretakers, knowledge carriers, liminal stabilizers.

## Fortress (high-level)
- Matriarchic, isolated, shaped by historic trauma around males.
- Isolation protects, but also risks rot / extinction.
