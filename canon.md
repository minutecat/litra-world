# Canon (stable truths)

This file contains rules and conditions that are unlikely to change.
If something feels situational, thematic, or unresolved, it does not belong here.

## Planetary law: "Getting Lost"
- Children may be relocated by the planet in an event known as "getting lost".
- This relocation is systemic and non-punitive.
- Return to the place of origin is not guaranteed.

## Colors and social status
- Tri-color is the typical developmental state.
- Mono-color indicates interrupted or incomplete social recognition.
- Mono-color is broadly treated as a permanent limitation within hierarchical systems.

## Rooks
- Some litrans lose a color when bypassing tribal borders.
- Those affected become known as "Rooks".
- Rooks are bound to border regions and function as caretakers, witnesses, and carriers of cross-tribal knowledge.

## Fortress (high-level)
- The fortress is a matriarchic and deliberately isolated society.
- Its structure is shaped by historic trauma related to male dominance.
- Isolation provides safety but increases the risk of long-term stagnation or extinction.

## Systemic absence
- A tribe can appear functional while missing a core role.
- When a role disappears (e.g. guarding), its responsibilities diffuse socially rather than vanish.
- This diffusion creates boundary drift: violations are normalized to avoid accountability.
