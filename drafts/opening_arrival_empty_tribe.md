# Opening: Arrival at the Destination (Draft)

## Core premise
The main character arrives at a planet-appointed destination and finds the tribe area empty.
He expected a safe, inspiring environment where effort and training would translate into care and encouragement.
Instead he receives freedom + silence.

## Environmental traces
- shattered tents near fresh water
- bushes, wild creatures
- crates with expired food
- a coin with a hole in the middle on a string (bracelet-like)

## Key action
He buries the coin in a memorable place (anchor memory without possessing it).

## Night 1 behavior
- assembles a fireplace and a tent
- prepares food for the night and next day
- stops there (minimal functional bubble; avoids overcommitting)

## “Failure”
Not survival. Diagnosis.
He cannot infer what caused the tribe’s disappearance/collapse.
The place is not hostile; it is opaque.

## Next-day decision
He follows the creek (reduces variables; avoids carrying water; increases chance of finding food / traces).
