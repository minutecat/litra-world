# Draft Terms & Working Language

This file collects provisional words and concepts.
Nothing here is canon. Terms may be renamed, merged, or discarded.

## Staying near without intervening
Working description:
- Being present alongside a system or person
- Accepting influence without intentional steering
- Caring without authority, ownership, or extraction

Working terms (not committed):
- parattending (tentative; may be misleading)
- sideholding
- liminal care
- withstanding (with + stand)
- nearletting

Notes:
This concept is ethically loaded and resists clean naming.
Discomfort with terminology is expected and acceptable.

## Parasitism (contrast term)
Literal origin:
- para (beside) + sitos (food)
- “one who eats at your table”

Used as a negative contrast:
- adjacency without contribution
- presence that extracts

This serves as a boundary marker for what the main character avoids becoming.

## Belonging that costs too much
Working description:
- A form of belonging that is available but ethically refused
- Entry would stabilize the self while destabilizing the system

Possible future naming needed.

## Assigned meaning
Working description:
- Meaning imposed after the fact by circumstance
- Common among Rooks and other fixed-role groups
- Maintained through care rather than belief in fairness

## Narrative importance of “staying near”
- Appears when leaving is no longer the hardest option.
- Harder than intervention because it forbids control.
- Distinct from neutrality: presence still has consequence.
- Central to the Wanderer’s later development.
