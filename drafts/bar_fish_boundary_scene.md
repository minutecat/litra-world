# Bar Scene: Fish, Boundary Drift, and Quiet Fear (Draft)

## Setup
- Wanderer enters a busy bar in the current tribe.
- He asks for work first (not food/drink) to signal function over entitlement.
- He has a full bag of fish from travel; he is not starving.

## The boundary drift
- Fish are taken from his bag bit-by-bit by petty opportunists.
- The key signal is not the taking itself, but the lack of collective response.
- The room treats boundary violations as "non-events" to avoid follow-up responsibility.

## The confrontation (nonviolent, structural)
- Wanderer approaches one taker who has taken multiple fish.
- He asks for one fish back because he is hungry.
- The taker attempts social inversion: accuses him of robbery ("How do you know it was yours?").

## The proof-trick
- Wanderer claims the fish was marked internally (implied hidden proof).
- He prompts the taker to cut it open.
- Unknown to the taker, the Wanderer has repositioned the fish’s poisonous organ.
- When cut, the organ pops and ruins the fish completely.

## Meaning
- The action forces a boundary to become visible without violence.
- It demonstrates that uncontained “taking” can annihilate value, not just redistribute it.
- The room’s reaction matters: a hidden ambient fear appears, then neutrality returns.

## Exit beat
- Wanderer looks up, registers the tribe’s reflex to normalize and forget.
- He leaves immediately to preserve clarity and avoid becoming the missing guard.
- Unintentional honesty test: one witness should follow him outside to speak.
