## Boundary Rot (working term)

Boundary rot describes what happens when a system loses the ability to enforce limits,
but continues to function by normalizing violations instead.

It is not chaos.
It is not collapse.
It is **stability maintained through silent erosion**.

Signs of boundary rot:
- violations occur without confrontation,
- responsibility diffuses socially,
- witnesses learn that speaking costs more than silence,
- value is not protected, only redistributed or wasted,
- the system appears healthy until pressure is applied.

Boundary rot accelerates when:
- core roles disappear (e.g. guards),
- enforcement is replaced with smoothing,
- endurance is mistaken for resilience.

Boundary rot does not announce itself.
It teaches participants that noticing is optional.
