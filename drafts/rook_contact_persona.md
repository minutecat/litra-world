# Rook Contact Persona (Draft)

## Role
- The rook encountered by the main character is a catalyst, not a gatekeeper.
- They have seen many mono-color litras pass through from the abandoned tribe.
- None returned to claim or repopulate the territory.

## Disposition
- Calm, precise, emotionally economical.
- Neither hopeful nor cynical; simply attentive.
- Does not dramatize collapse or assign blame.

## Context awareness
- Aware that the abandoned tribe shows no inward movement.
- Understands this as a long-form failure, not a sudden event.
- Has likely been near isolation risk themselves.

## Interaction ethic
- Does not offer guidance or direction.
- Adds friction rather than answers.
- Tests whether uncertainty can be carried without premature closure.

## Non-exceptionality
- The main character is not treated as special or chosen.
- The same interaction pattern has been used before.
- Difference lies in response, not in the test itself.
