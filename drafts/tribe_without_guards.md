# Current Tribe: Functional, Missing Guards (Draft)

## Context
- The abandoned territory was the former Guards territory, but the Wanderer does not know this yet.
- The current tribe appears busy, functional, and full of options.
- The root instability is that "guarding" as an externalized role/system is missing from the region.

## How the tribe compensates
- Containment is replaced with social smoothing.
- Prevention is replaced with reactive cleanup.
- Boundaries exist socially (negotiated), not structurally (enforced).
- The system stays "well" by pushing costs into private endurance.

## Wanderer’s experience
- Feels better than the empty place: density, roles, circulation, movement.
- Feels worse than the empty place: mono-color status makes him instantly classifiable and capped.
- Risk: he becomes a replacement for a missing system (a stopgap), not a true member.
