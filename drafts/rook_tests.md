# Rook Tests and Friction Patterns (Draft)

## Purpose
- Rook tests are diagnostic, not evaluative.
- They do not seek correct answers.
- They probe how a litra handles unresolved variables.

## Common opener
“How many times did you get lost?”

## Interpretations
- Once: standard relocation outcome.
- Twice: feared; implies loss of anchoring without explanation.
- More than twice: suggests repeated failure to stabilize.

## Test structure
- Not riddles or puzzles.
- Often a true but incomplete statement.
- Delivered without instruction or follow-up.

## Passing criteria
- Not immediate response.
- Observed over time through movement choices and restraint.
- Carrying the variable without forcing closure.

## Passphrase
- May be non-verbal.
- Recognized as a pattern of behavior by other rooks.
- Informally described as “having been spoken to”.

## Fairness
- Repopulating an abandoned tribe is not required.
- Leaving via another neighbor is valid.
- No moral ranking of outcomes.

## Example signal (tribe without guards)
A boundary violation becomes meaningful not when it happens, but when the system refuses follow-up.
A “test” can be the absence of response, not the event itself.
