# Status in Matriarchy (Draft)

## Status tends to track
- reliability under stress (who people orient around)
- buffering (who absorbs consequences vs who is insulated)
- interpretive power (who names what matters and what gets normalized)

## Layers
- Low-status: unbuffered; absorbs costs privately; notices cracks early; low leverage.
- Mid-status: connective; coordinates/smooths/translates; high social trust, limited structural power; prone to exhaustion.
- High-status: symbolic stabilizers (elders/influencers); interpret what is “fine” vs “serious”; can normalize or fracture norms.

## Missing role in current tribe
- With Guards gone, “hard stop” authority is absent.
- Boundaries drift into negotiation and endurance.

## Witness choice implication
- Low-status witness: speaks because silence is unaffordable.
- Mid-status witness: speaks because pattern recognition becomes fear.
- High-status witness: speaks because normalization cracked (seismic).
