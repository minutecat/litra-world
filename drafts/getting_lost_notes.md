# Getting Lost — Notes (Draft)

## Planet intent axis (unresolved)

The planet’s behavior can be interpreted along an axis, not a conclusion.

At one extreme, the planet appears **adaptive**:
- reallocating individuals to preserve long-term systemic health,
- enforcing diversity through disruption,
- correcting stagnation without moral judgment.

At the other extreme, the planet appears **indifferent**:
- executing ancient mechanisms without awareness,
- allowing extinctions as side effects,
- treating individuals as variables, not subjects.

Between these extremes lies a third interpretation:
the planet is **selectionist but non-caring** —
it creates conditions where adaptation is possible,
but does not intervene in outcomes.

Important:
- No character has enough information to resolve this.
- Belief about the planet reveals the believer, not the truth.
- “Getting lost” is experienced as injustice regardless of intent.

This axis should remain open.
Any attempt to close it prematurely is a narrative failure.

## What an average litra expects
- "Getting lost" is anticipated and trained for; it is framed as a life passage, not a punishment.
- Litra survival skills are sufficient to live independently (nature’s gifts + training), so relocation is not “abandonment”.

## Memory blurring (common effect)
- After relocation, relational specificity blurs:
  - parents’ faces
  - close friends (who, what they looked like)
  - trainers (who trained them)
- Skills and identity remain, but the emotional “texture” of belonging becomes harder to retrieve.
- Intent: reduce nostalgia-anchoring so the mind can re-root and learn without constant backward pull.

## Social reality
- Many litras feel injustice at first (“I trained, so life should become easier”).
- Anger may be common and later fades after full integration.
- “Getting lost” may be semi-taboo: not forbidden, but often discussed only after someone has stabilized.
