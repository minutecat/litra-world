# Rooks — Culture and Accountability (Draft)

## Core identity
Rooks consider one another family.
Not by choice, but by shared fate: loss of color, restriction to borders (“gardens”), and long-term exposure to system-level patterns.

They do not see themselves as judges or rulers.
They think of themselves as secretaries of movement and continuity.

## Trust and hierarchy
- Rooks trust each other deeply.
- There is no formal hierarchy.
- Respect is given based on:
  - age
  - cultural heritage
  - prior experience with rare or catastrophic patterns
- Elders are valued as compressed experience, not authority.

## Knowledge sharing
- Rooks maintain a vast, distributed knowledge base.
- They monitor:
  - direction and frequency of litra movement
  - duration of stays
  - repeated crossings
  - migration triggers
  - follower dynamics
- Direct contact with all litras is unnecessary; patterns matter more than testimony.
- Black birds are used for peer-to-peer signaling, mentoring, and warning — not command.

## Intervention ethic
- Rooks avoid early intervention unless patterns demand it.
- Premature certainty is considered dangerous; waiting is an ethical act.
- They act when absence of action would falsify the record.

## Failure and accountability
- If two neighboring tribes go empty, the associated border no longer makes sense.
- Greys will locate the rook responsible and lock them between the meaningless borders.
- This is not punishment but forced accountability:
  - information flow is cut
  - black birds no longer arrive
  - movement becomes constrained
- The rook must find a way to repopulate at least one side to restore relevance.

## Internal response
- When isolation becomes inevitable, other rooks prepare the affected one.
- Training focuses on:
  - survival without information flow
  - maintaining mental integrity under silence
  - relearning purpose without patterns
- This is considered the highest form of care rooks can offer.

## Cultural tension
Rooks care deeply but act rarely.
They are defined by the burden of knowing that observation without intervention can still carry cost.
