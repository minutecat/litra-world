# Border Contact: Calling a Rook (Draft)

## Setup
Before moving fully into neighboring tribes, he stops at the border of the abandoned tribe.
He sends a black bird to signal the rooks and waits for one to appear.

## Signal nuance
- Mono-color is not a sufficient signal of “planet-sent” vs “just passing through” because mono-color litras can move freely without changing colors.
- Still, a mono-color litra sending a black bird matters: it signals border literacy + intent to speak in the rook’s domain.

## Opening line (rook)
“How many times did you get lost?”

## Interpretations of answers (rook mental model)
- “Once” : normal (cubs start tri-color; mono-color implies a single relocation + its consequences).
- “Twice” : feared / destabilizing (suggests unexplained further loss; unpredictable anchoring).
- “More than two” : suggests repeated failure to stabilize (wild nature / poor survival / avoidance patterns).

## Purpose of the question
Not moral judgment — diagnostic: how displacement has shaped the caller’s reliability and risk.

## Variable limits
- Rooks only register litras after first border crossing.
- Origin tribes are one variable among many.
- Planetary intent is not fully traceable.
- Consulting a rook is optional, not normative.

## Outcome diversity
- Not all relocated litras are experimentalists.
- Not all experimentalists consult rooks.
- Returning to repopulate is one solution among many neighboring paths.
