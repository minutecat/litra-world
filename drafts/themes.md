# Themes (Draft)

This file captures thematic questions and balances.
These are not arguments or conclusions.

## Lost purpose and equilibrium
- Traditional male-coded roles (protection, provision, dominance) lose clarity in safer systems.
- Loss of role does not imply loss of value, but loss of instruction.

## Quiet skill inheritance
- Female-coded survival skills (emotional regulation, social navigation, delayed influence)
  often develop under constraint rather than recognition.
- These skills become critical during systemic transition.

## Neither side idealized
- Matriarchic systems provide safety but risk stagnation.
- Patriarchic systems provide momentum but risk domination.
- The story explores balance, not replacement.

## Usefulness without centrality
- Contribution does not require ownership or authority.
- The Wanderer embodies non-central usefulness as an ethic.

## Continuity without possession
- Care can enable futures one does not inhabit.
- Leaving can be ethical rather than avoidant.
