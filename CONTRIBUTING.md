# Contributing to Litra World

This project is primarily a **personal world-building space**.
Contributions are welcome in spirit, but not assumed in practice.

## What contributions mean here
- Asking better questions
- Pointing out inconsistencies
- Proposing alternative interpretations
- Suggesting names, structures, or failure modes

This is **not** a request for:
- Fan fiction
- Canon additions without discussion
- Optimization toward popularity or tropes

## How decisions are made
- Canon is intentionally conservative
- Drafts are allowed to contradict each other
- Nothing becomes stable until it survives time and rereading

If something feels unfinished, unclear, or uncomfortable:
that’s usually a feature, not a bug.

## Tone expectations
- Curiosity over certainty
- Precision over volume
- Respect for ambiguity

This world is built to **withstand scrutiny**, not to perform.

## Practical note
At the moment, all final decisions are made by the repository owner.
Forks are encouraged if you want to explore alternate paths.
