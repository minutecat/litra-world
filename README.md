# Litra World

Litra World is a long-form world-building project centered on adaptation,
belonging, and the cost of movement in a structured society.

This repository does **not** aim to present a finished story.
It captures canon, drafts, questions, and structural decisions as they evolve.

## What this is
- A living world with rules that resist simplification
- A narrative focused on contribution without centrality
- A place to think carefully before writing decisively

## What this is not
- A collaborative fiction playground (yet)
- A trope-driven fantasy setting
- A project optimized for speed or scale

## How to read this repo
- `canon.md` → stable truths
- `STATUS.md` → current thinking
- `drafts/` → ideas in motion
- `characters/` → people, not roles
- `world/` → structure before plot

If something feels unresolved, that’s intentional.

_Last updated deliberately, not frequently._
