# Arc Overview

This document describes the high-level narrative progression of the story.
It is not a chapter list, but a map of internal and structural shifts.

## 1) Getting Lost
The main character is born into a tribe he will not grow up in.
By planetary law ("getting lost"), he is relocated elsewhere as a child.
This event establishes displacement as systemic, not personal failure.

## 2) The Dead Destination
The tribe he is sent to no longer exists.
There are no cultural traces left to integrate into.
As a result, he remains mono-color, symbolizing interrupted recognition and unfinished belonging.

## 3) Early Wandering
With no origin and no destination, he begins to wander.
He integrates into a neighboring tribe out of necessity.
Despite competence and growth, mono-color status prevents upward movement.
He leaves.

## 4) Skill Accumulation Across Tribes
He passes through multiple tribes.
Each stay adds skills, perspectives, and adaptive strategies.
Leaving becomes more deliberate over time: sometimes due to limits, sometimes by choice.
His identity forms around usefulness without permanence.

## 5) The Fortress
He encounters the fortress: matriarchic, isolated, and near extinction.
For the first time, belonging appears possible.
Through the trainer’s story, he chooses not to center himself.
He follows her instead, exploring usefulness without authority.

## 6) Return and Decentering
They return to the fortress with new possibilities.
The system begins to stabilize, but not because of him alone.
He realizes this moment is not his story to inhabit fully.
Problems remain, but they no longer require him as a solution.

## 7) The Rooks (Checkpoint)
He joins the Rooks temporarily.
This serves as a checkpoint rather than an ending.
Through them, he gains perspective on borders, assignment, and care without control.
The story opens outward rather than closing.
