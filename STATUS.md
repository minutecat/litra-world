## Currently thinking about
- The emotional cost of leaving vs. staying for the main character.
- The concept of “staying near without intervening” (working terms, not finalized).
- The role of the Rooks as a checkpoint rather than an endpoint.
- How masculinity adapts when traditional roles (protection, provision) lose clarity.

## Open questions (intentionally unresolved)
- What is the long-term fate of the fortress after reopening?
- How do Rooks cope with being chosen without consent?
- What does healthy non-central contribution look like over time?
- Does the main character ever stop wandering, or just wander differently?

## Not working on right now
- Final prose
- Chapter-level structure
- Naming every concept precisely

## Next small step
- Capture emerging terms and concepts in `drafts/terms.md`.

## Recent progress

- Defined rook culture as trust-based, non-hierarchical, pattern-oriented observers.
- Captured accountability mechanics: gardens (borders), greys, and rook isolation when borders lose meaning.
- Clarified that rook tests are diagnostic friction, not chosen-one trials.
- Defined the abandoned-tribe contact rook as a catalyst, not a gatekeeper.
- Explicitly rejected “repopulation = proof” logic; multiple valid outcomes acknowledged.
