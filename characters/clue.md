- She listens without interrupting
- She rarely speaks unless something matters

She kept it.

## Role in the Story
- Breaker of silence after the bar incident
- Moral calibrator, not an authority
- Trains attention rather than obedience
- Does not anchor the Wanderer — sharpens him

## Relationship to the Wanderer
- Initiates contact
- Maintains social advantage without exploiting it
- Recognizes restraint as competence

## Core Tension
Clue sees moral drift in her tribe.
She stays silent to prevent abuse of leniency.
This silence costs her credibility and intimacy.

She does not follow the Wanderer to keep him.
She follows him to confirm something about herself.
