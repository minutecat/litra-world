# The Wanderer

This document describes the main character’s internal ethic and recurring choices.
It is not a biography and not a complete psychological profile.

## Working function (not final)

The Wanderer is not a solver of problems, nor a reformer of systems.

His function is to **reveal what a system is willing to ignore in order to remain stable**.

He does this by:
- entering without entitlement,
- operating competently without authority,
- allowing boundary failures to surface without enforcing correction,
- leaving before the system can externalize responsibility onto him.

He does not fix what is broken.
He clarifies **who would have to care** for it to be fixed.

If a system improves after his presence, it is because it chose to.
If it collapses, it was already collapsing.

## Core condition
- He is permanently mono-color due to interrupted belonging.
- This is not experienced as tragedy alone, but as a structural limit that never disappears.

## What he seeks
- To be useful without becoming central.
- To belong without possession or entitlement.
- To understand systems well enough not to damage them.

## What he avoids becoming
- A parasite (adjacent but extractive).
- A savior (central, corrective, dependency-creating).
- A ruler or moral authority.
- A permanent fixture that freezes a system around himself.

## Recurring choice pattern
- When offered belonging that would stabilize him but destabilize others, he leaves.
- When capable of solving a problem directly, he looks for ways to decenter himself.
- When staying is possible, restraint becomes harder than departure.

## Emotional costs
- Persistent uncertainty about whether leaving is care or avoidance.
- Fear of being remembered incorrectly: as absent rather than deliberate.
- A quiet grief for futures he chooses not to inhabit.

## Developmental tension
- Early wandering is driven by necessity.
- Later wandering becomes a practiced ethic.
- His challenge is not learning to leave, but learning how to stay near without controlling.

## Relationship to the world
- Systems change slightly after he passes through them.
- He resists interpreting this as success.
- Meaning is something he contributes to carefully, never claims.
