# Territorial Map (Hex Layout)

This document describes the current territorial layout of the litran world,
using a hexagonal model. The map is functional, not symbolic: adjacency explains
behavior, pressure, and failure modes.

The system consists of:
- one **central territory** (Guards),
- a **core ring** of six territories,
- and an **outer ring** that amplifies or absorbs instability.

Guards’ absence is the primary destabilizing factor.
