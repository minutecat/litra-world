# Rooks

Rooks are border-bound litras who lost a color after crossing tribal borders.

They did not choose this role.
The planet chose it for them.

## Function
- Monitor movement across borders ("gardens")
- Track patterns, not individuals
- Act as distributed memory

## Constraints
- Can only move along borders
- Can traverse the planet via connected borders
- Cannot enter tribal interiors

## Accountability Mechanism
If both neighboring tribes collapse:
- Greys isolate the rook
- Communication is cut
- The rook is trapped until one side repopulates

This is not punishment.
It is exposure.

## Culture
- Non-hierarchical
- Age and experience respected
- Extreme internal trust

Rooks do not test for worth.
They test for **continuity**.

Rooks remember what tribes forget.
