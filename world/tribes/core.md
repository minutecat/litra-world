# Core Territories

These seven territories form the load-bearing structure of the world.

## Guards (central, currently empty)
Former role:
- enforcement
- response
- protection of flows and borders

Current state:
- unexplained abandonment
- infrastructure remains, authority does not

Effect:
Guards’ absence does not create immediate danger.
It creates silence, delay, and moral ambiguity in neighboring territories.

## Mediators
Role:
- coordination between people
- hosting, negotiation, redistribution
- conflict diffusion rather than resolution

Traits:
- socially warm
- morally fragile under pressure
- relies on attention, not authority

Failure mode:
Petty theft, norm erosion, and “flow logic” replace accountability.

---

## Crafts
Role:
- tools, repair, infrastructure, transit
- keeps systems operable even when governance fails

Traits:
- pragmatic
- efficiency-focused
- morally flexible when under strain

Failure mode:
Shortcuts normalize.
Fixing replaces asking why something broke.

## Resources
Role:
- food, raw materials, preservation
- seasonal abundance management

Traits:
- practical
- scarcity-aware
- loss-sensitive

Failure mode:
Untracked losses increase.
Shortages appear without clear causes.

## Banks
Role:
- storage of value
- custody, trust, delayed exchange

Traits:
- quiet
- procedural
- conservative

Failure mode:
Trust decays slowly.
Assumptions outlive reality.

## Archives
Role:
- memory, precedent, training, rites
- preservation without enforcement

Traits:
- slow
- patient
- observant

Failure mode:
They know something is wrong,
but cannot act without authority.

---

## Margins
Role:
- absorption of misfits, wanderers, overflow
- pressure release for the system

Traits:
- flexible
- non-judgmental
- loosely structured

Failure mode:
Disappearance without alarm.
Loss becomes invisible.
