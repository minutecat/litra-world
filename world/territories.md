# Tribal Territories Overview

Tribal territories are arranged in a **hexagonal system**.
Each tribe specializes in a function that only remains stable
if neighboring functions also remain healthy.

No tribe is self-sufficient.
Empty territories are structurally dangerous.

## Core Ring (Story Focus)

### Banks
- Storage, long-term safekeeping, delayed exchange
- Underground infrastructure
- Origin of the Wanderer

### Guards (Abandoned)
- Protection, stabilization, emergency response
- Currently empty
- The absence of Guards destabilizes multiple neighbors

### Mediators
- Social calibration, conflict diffusion, trust repair
- First populated tribe the Wanderer enters
- Clue belongs here

### Crafts
- Toolmaking, repair, applied knowledge
- Dependent on Banks and Guards for stability

### Resources
- Managed extraction and provisioning
- Interfaces with Fields and Foragers

### Margins
- Peripheral experimentation, edge survival
- Produces wanderers, rooks, and anomalies

### Archives
- Cultural memory, training lineage, pattern retention
- Not passive libraries — active interpretation

## Outer Ring (Functional Neighbors)

### Commons
- Shared neutral grounds
- High traffic, low ownership

### Markets
- Exchange without storage
- Reputation-based valuation

### Fields
- Cultivation and biological cycles

### Foragers
- Mobile provisioning, wild knowledge

### Wastes
- Decay, failed systems, abandoned experiments

### Relics
- Obsolete but dangerous artifacts

### Schools
- Practical training, not doctrine

### Couriers
- Message and object transfer

### Mints
- Value stabilization and symbolic currency

### Quarries
- Raw material extraction

### Forges
- High-risk transformation

### Junctions
- Transit logic and flow optimization

## Structural Note
When a tribe disappears:
- Neighboring tribes compensate quietly
- Rooks monitor borders
- Collapse propagates slowly, not explosively
